This is my first major project that is more of a sandbox for learning django. 
I doubt anyone else should ever be interested in this, but its a simple polling app for guaging the relative interest
of different interesting social trends. It has been since been abandoned in favor of more entertaining groupme chatbots
hosted through heroku.
